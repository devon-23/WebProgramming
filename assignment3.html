                <p>Solstices and Equinoxes are two important phenomenons that have been observed for centuries. But what exactly are they?</p>
                <p>Both events happen twice a year but serve two different purposes. Now, solstices and equinoxes are observed to mark the begining and ending of seasons.</p>
                <p>This webpage will go over what exactly they are and the culture & history surrounding the phenomenon.</p>

                        <p>A solar equinox happens twice a year on or around September 22 and March 21, which marks the first day of Fall and Spring, respectively. Equinoxes are when the sun crosses the Earth's equator which causes the time of day and time of night to be equal all over Earth. This phenomenon has been celebrated for centuries and has been incorporated into many ancient structures. Our Ancestors were able to identify and map out this occurrence and build structures to celebrate the solstice. Some ancestors went as far as building structures Â¾ of a degree off to account for the solstice sun rising due East and moving as it rises to get the effect of the sun sitting on top of the center pillar. Pictured on the left is the Chichen Itza in Mexico. At the spring solstice, a serpent can be seen from the shadow of the temple.</p>

                        <p>A solar solstice occurs twice a year on or around June 21 and December 21, which marks the first day of Summer and Winter, respectivily. Solstices are when the path of the sun is farthest north/south. This is when you get the longest or shortest days of the year. Much like the equinox, many ancestors built structures incorperating this phenomenon into their engineering plans. One of the most popular structures is Stonehenge located in England. Pictured on the left is that phenomenon occuring during sunrise. Traditionally, this was celebrated as "the return of the light, life, fertility, and the potential for a good harvest". </p>
